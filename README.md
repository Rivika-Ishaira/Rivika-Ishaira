## Hi there 👋

I’m **Rivika Ishaira**, a frontend-focused developer who enjoys building clean, thoughtful, and user-friendly interfaces.

I mostly work with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind**, and I like adding subtle motion and interactions when they enhance the experience. I care a lot about simplicity, clarity, and how things *feel* to use — not just how they look.

This is a fresh profile where I’ll be sharing smaller projects, experiments, and things I’m currently working on. Everything here is built from scratch — no copy/paste templates, just learning and building.

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- React, TypeScript, Tailwind  
- Motion & micro-interactions  
- Figma for UI design and layouts  
- Notes & sketches for planning ideas  

---

### 🌱 A Bit About Me
- I enjoy simple, minimal, and functional design  
- Prefer clarity over complexity  
- Like experimenting and learning by doing  
- Into anime and storytelling  
- Always improving, always curious  

---

✨ More projects coming soon.
